					<h3>Exchange Student, <em>Jan 2020 - April 2020</em></h3>
					<p>
						<b>Vallendar, Germany</b>
						<br><br>
						Decided to end my last undergraduate semester abroad as an end of graduation gift. Not only did I meet and party with great people, but I got to see all of Europe; from the Swiss Alps to the Van Gogh Musuem to the Sagrada Familia, I will always remember this time as a moment of appreciation to nature and European culture.

					<h3>Software Engineer Intern, <em>Sept 2019 - Nov 2019</em></h3>
					<p>

						Took a semester off to work in Beautiful Boring Bristol. Got to work with the connected devices team on the WatchESPN iOS SDK which handles video playback. Implemented telemetry to monitor errors, network requests, and concurrency monitoring. Learned a lot about mobile development and drastically improved my Swift programming to the point where it is my undisputed favorite language. Thankful for my mentor Alex and boss John for setting me up for success.

		<h1>Hello, I'm Henry Vuong</h1>
		<img src="images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="profile-pic">
		<p>
			I'm a a senior at UT Austin &#129304 studying Management Information Systems. I'm slated to graduate in May 2020.

		<h2>Here's what I've done so far</h2>

		<img src="images/WHU.png" alt="WHU" width="250px">
		<h3>WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Business</h3>
		<p>
			Attended a study abroad program in Germany.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Cooking</h2>
	<p>
		LOVE cooking and grocery shopping. Always trying to try out new dishes I find on YouTube.
		Favorite dishes include:
		<div class="unorderdList">
			<ul>
				<li>Spaghetti Carbonara</li>
				<li>Chicken Thighs Chorizo Tacos</li>
				<li>Chinese Dumplings</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</p>

	<h2>Coding</h2>
	<p>
		Not sure if I <em>love, love</em> coding, but it's something I plan on doing as a career. I love learning new technologies and have a big passion for creating things. Will be a software development engineer Intern at Amazon Summer 2020.
	</p>

	<h2>Basketball</h2>
	<p>
		I love a lot of sports but basketball is one of those things in life that you can pick up even when you're tired, sad, or out of it. Something about focussing on putting the Spalding into the basket transcends all thoughts to focussing on this very trivial task. I love it.
